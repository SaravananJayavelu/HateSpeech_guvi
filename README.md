# HateSpeech_guvi
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and mitigate hate speech in online platforms through a comprehensive approach that encompasses contextual analysis, temporal analysis, user profiling, geospatial analysis, false positive/negative analysis, and hate speech detection. By addressing these aspects, the project aims to enhance our understanding of hate speech dynamics, identify patterns and trends over time, profile users prone to engaging in hate speech, analyze geographic distributions, evaluate model performance, and ultimately develop effective strategies to detect and mitigate hate speech online.
# Approach
Contextual Analysis:
Analyze the textual context provided in the dataset to understand the linguistic patterns, sentiment, and thematic content associated with hate speech.
Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the text data.
Temporal Analysis:
Investigate temporal patterns and trends in hate speech occurrences over time.
Hate Speech Detection:
Develop and train Deep Learning models to detect hate speech in online contexts.
# Skills Outcome:
Proficiency in data preprocessing techniques for textual data. Understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis.
Ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights from datasets.
Experience in building and training Deep Learning models for classification tasks.
Competence in evaluating model performance and interpreting results.
Skills in data visualization and storytelling to communicate findings effectively
